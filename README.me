My Hyprland Setup! (on Arch btw)
-I built my arch using the official arch installation guide. From there I installed KDE as a desktop interface. I wanted both hyprland and a more stable/reliable desktop interface incase I came across issues while setting up hyprland.
-I used yay as my package manager and installed hyprland, waybar, and hyprpaper for the aesthetics.
